## The docs folder

The project includes a sub-project in the 'docs' folder. It contains the documentation that you are reading now.

Using this in-project documentation is completely optional. You may prefer to use the [online version](https://mysql-to-zod.pages.dev/).

**If you choose to use this in-project documentation ...**

This is built and run separately from the mysql-to-zod project.

The documentation project is based on [Astro](https://astro.build/), which uses local .mdx files (slightly enhanced Markdown) to generate a local website that hosts the documentation.

## Setup

After you [install PNPM](/getting-started/pnpm), open a terminal to the 'docs' folder, and `pnpm install` to load node_modules with all dependencies, including Astro. (Or use the familiar `npm` if you prefer.)

## Generate deployable docs

Build the docs project using the script in package.json.

## View the docs in the browser

Run the docs project using the "dev" or "start" script in package.json. In this mode the doc pages refresh as files are saved in the project.

Open a browser and connect to the URL provided in the console. You can use the information there to guide you through setting the configuration file and generating your schema.
