## Offer your ideas

As you use mysql-to-zod you may have ideas for enhancements, to add new details to schema that benefit applications.

Ideas might include:

- the addition of more type information
- extending from base types
- using interfaces
- enhancements to the use of globalSchema or other base details
- generating base classes
- more complex replacements
- use of new Zod features
- a new output type to facilitate post-processing

Just remember that the focus of this project is to read schema from MySQL and to write TypeScript files with Zod schema definitions. This is a very specific focus that might not include other functionality, like reading from another database or generating UI components.
