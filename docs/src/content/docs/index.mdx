## What is mysql-to-zod?

mysql-to-zod is a tool that generates Zod type definitions from MySQL table definitions.

## Usage

```bash
npx mysql-to-zod mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname
```

The above command will generate Zod-specific type definitions of all tables in "dbname", saving the new TypeScript code in `./mysqlToZod/schema.ts`.

## Example

Suppose DB: my_todo has the following table definitions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE todo (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  task VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

From the above table definition, the following Zod schema is generated.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

export const todoSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  task: z.string(),
  completed: z.number(),
  created_at: z.date().nullish(),
  updated_at: z.date().nullish(),
});
export type Todo = z.infer<typeof todoSchema>;
```

## Summary

These are the basic instructions for use. In many cases the above is all that is needed.  
But with extensive [options](/options/config) many details can be customized.
For example, you may want the variable name to be `TODO_SCHEMA` instead of `todoSchema`.
