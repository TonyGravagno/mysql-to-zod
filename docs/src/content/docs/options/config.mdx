## Configuration file location

Place the configuration file in the directory where you want to run it.
If you want to run it in `/home/user/develop/project001`, place `/home/user/develop/project001/mysqlToZod.config.js`.

## How to write a configuration file

The configuration file should be written as follows

```js
const options = {
  output: {
    outDir: "./mysqlToZod",
    fileName: "schema.ts",
  },
  comments: {
    table: {
      active: true,
      format: "// [table:!name] : !text",
    },
    column: {
      active: true,
      format: "// !name : !text",
    },
  },
  type: {
    declared: "type",
    format: "pascal",
    prefix: "",
    suffix: "",
    replacements: [],
  },
  schema: {
    format: "camel",
    prefix: "",
    suffix: "Schema",
    replacements: [],
    nullType: "nullish",
    inline: true,
    zod: {
      implementation: [],
      references: [],
    },
  },
  sync: {
    active: true,
  },
};
module.exports = options;
```
