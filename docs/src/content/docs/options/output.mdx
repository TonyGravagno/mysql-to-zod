Details for each `options.output` parameter follow. Descriptions are prefaced with the field type and defailt value.

## Details

### outDir

(string : `.` ) The output directory where all files generated from this utility are written.

- This folder is relative to the current working directory where the mysql-to-zod utility is executed.
- At this time the folder name must be relative, with a leading "./" or "../". Do not use an absolute path here.
- Forward slashes are used in all operating systems.
- Even when the configuration file is specified at the command-line with the -f option, the output directory is relative to the command-line folder (cwd/pwd), not relative to the config folder. This allows the same configuration file to be used with multiple projects, always writing current project files, starting in the current project folder.
- Examples: "./schemaForThisProject" and "../../projects/allSchemaFolder"

### fileName

(string : `schema.ts`) File name for the single .ts file to which all schema is written.

- For example, for "allSchema.ts", the TypeScript for all tables will be written to this file.

### saveSql

(boolean : false) Specifies whether to save the SQL Create Table query for all tables.

- This is a purely informational feature. Use this option to understand the RDBMS tables that are being processed, for comparison with the resulting Zod schema. For example: If the SQL shows a column is "int", it explains why the schema is z.number.
- If columns are not translated to Zod with expected syntax, please check this documentation for details and options, and feel free to check with us in the GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/araera111/mysql-to-zod/discussions) area, the [Discord](https://github.com/araera111/mysql-to-zod/wiki/Discord) server, or in a repo [Issue](https://github.com/araera111/mysql-to-zod/issues).

### sqlFileName

(string : `tablename`) When saveSql=true, this is the name of the SQL file(s) written.

- Similar to fileName, if a name like "allTables.sql" is used, the SQL for all tables will be saved in this one file.
- If this field is "tablename" (the default), one file will be generated for each table using the table name and the .sql extension. Examples : "person.sql" and "company.sql" (This dynamic filename option may be added for .ts files.)

### globalSchemaFileName

(string : `globals.ts`) The name of the global schema .ts file.

- Mysql-to-Zod can save all schema details for every table in the (fileName) .ts file. But common details will be replicated there many times for individual tables and across the entire set of tables processed. A global schema file can be created to store common features. When this is done, the primary schema file is modified for each field to refer to global schema definitions, rather than including all details in each field.
- As with saveSql and sqlFileName, when the option is set to save a global file, this is the filename to save.
- The directive to save a global schema file is in [options.schema.inline](/options/schema#inline) - set to true to save.
- _Note : This functionality is actively being developed to reduce redundancy, make effective use of Zod features, and improve developer options to abstract common functionality out of entity/class/table details. Questions and suggestions are always welcome._

### saveAst

(boolean : false) Save the raw parsed SQL query for all tables.

- This is a purely informational feature. For each table, a Create Table SQL query is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This structured object is the data source for table and column details.
- If the code generated by mysql-to-zod does not accurately reflect the SQL, the cause may be due to unexpected data, incorrect processing of data, or lack of necessary data.
- It is extremely helpful to have both the SQL (or a subset) and the AST to understand and/or change behavior in this utility.
- The AST is converted from a JavaScript object to a JSON string. Because of the size of these objects, each AST is written to a unique file following the tablename_ast.json pattern.
