# dbConnection

## Configuration Item

- dbConnection - Configures settings for connecting to mysql.

There are two ways to configure: URL syntax and Object syntax.

### URL syntax

URL syntax is set in the format `mysql://user:pass@host:port/database`

```js
module.exports = {
  dbConnection: "mysql://user:pass@host:port/database",
};
```

Also, if you specify `npx mysql-to-zod@latest mysql://user:pass@host:port/database`, it takes precedence over the setting described in the config file.

### Object syntax

The object syntax is set as follows.
Since this library uses mysql2, the mysql2 settings are described as they are.

```js
/** @type {import("./src/options/options").MysqlToZodOption} */
const options = {
  dbConnection: {
    host: "localhost",
    user: "user",
    password: "pass",
    database: "database",
  },
};
module.exports = options;
```

This is the same setting as the URL syntax described earlier.

If the password contains @, the URL syntax requires escaping, but the object syntax does not.
