## DB connection settings

## Setting items

- dbConnection - Configure settings to connect to mysql.

There are two ways to configure this: URL syntax and Object syntax.

### URL syntax

URL syntax is set in the format `mysql://user:pass@host:port/database`.

```js
module.exports = {
  dbConnection: "mysql://user:pass@host:port/database",
};
```

Also, if you specify `npx mysql-to-zod@latest mysql://user:pass@host:port/database` at runtime, what you specify at runtime takes precedence over the settings described in the config file.

### Object syntax

The Object syntax is set as follows.
Since this library uses mysql2, the mysql2 settings are described as they are.

```js
const options = {
  dbConnection: {
    host: "localhost",
    user: "user",
    password: "pass",
    database: "database",
  },
};
module.exports = options;
```

This is the same setting as the URL syntax described earlier.

If the password contains @, the URL syntax requires escaping, but the object syntax does not.
